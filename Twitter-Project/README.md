#Shaving Company Twitter Account Analysis:

The script assumes a postgresql database is set up with a table named "company_tweets" in database "twitter". You'll need to update username and password in the code.

Once that is set up, simply run the script in your terminal and it will prompt you to enter how many twitter handles (users) you'll be extracting tweets from. For this assignment, enter "4".  It will then ask you for a twitter handle that many times (harrys, gillette, SchickHydro, dollarshaveclub). After that, it will extract about 3200 of the most recent tweets from each account.

You can then view the analysis in the ipython notebook.
